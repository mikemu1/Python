    <h1>Michael &amp; Deborah's Page</h1>
    <h2>Under (re)construction</h2>
    <p>We are the senior Oregon (Ã”r' &#x12D; g&#601;n) residents in the Northwestern branch 
        of our family, although we both have Midwestern roots. Deborah was born in 
        Terre Haute, Indiana, and came to Portland with her parents when she was three. Michael 
        is from St. Louis and didn't arrive here until twenty years later. Deborah's son Jonathan 
        was born here in 1978.</p>
